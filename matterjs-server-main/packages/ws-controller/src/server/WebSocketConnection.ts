 * common case. When a send pushes `ws.bufferedAmount` over the high-water mark the connection flips
 * to **queued** mode: frames drain from a single ordered outbox, kept-in-flight up to `highWater`
 * bytes (a window, not one frame at a time) so the pipe stays full and delivery is not serialized to
 * one round-trip per frame — which over a high-latency relay would stall a burst. Each flush callback
 * frees window space and pulls more. Attribute/node-snapshot sends coalesce latest-wins per key;
 * events are FIFO and, past the cap, dropped oldest-first. An in-flight send stalled beyond the
 * watchdog closes the dead connection. The outbox empties → back to direct mode.

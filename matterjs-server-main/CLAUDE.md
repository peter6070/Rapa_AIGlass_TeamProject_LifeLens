# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents working with code in this repository. `AGENTS.md` is a symlink to this file, so agents reading either name get the same instructions.

## AI policy

This project follows the [Open Home Foundation AI Policy](AI_POLICY.md).
Autonomous contributions are not accepted: a human must review, understand,
and be able to explain every change before it is submitted. Do not open
issues or pull requests autonomously, and do not post comments on behalf of
a user without their review.

Additionally in this repository: never submit a bug report, root-cause claim,
or fix whose justification is an analysis without the complete raw log file it
is derived from.

## Project Overview

A Matter.js-based controller with a Python Matter Server compatible WebSocket interface, designed for Home Assistant integration. The server listens on `localhost:5580/ws` and provides a WebSocket API compatible with the Home Assistant Matter integration.

## Build & Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies and initial build
npm i

# Build all packages (incremental)
npm run build

# Clean build (full rebuild)
npm run build-clean

# Start the server
npm run server

# Start server with options
npm run server -- --storage-path data --primary-interface en0

# Run tests (uses @matter/testing with mocha).
# Integration tests (Commission On Network) need an explicit network interface,
# otherwise mDNS discovery picks up VPN/utun adapters and the test times out.
# Set both env vars to the active LAN interface (e.g. en0):
PRIMARY_INTERFACE=en0 MATTER_MDNS_NETWORKINTERFACE=en0 npm test

# Lint (oxlint with type-aware checking)
npm run lint
npm run lint-fix

# Format (oxfmt)
npm run format
npm run format-verify
```

## Monorepo Structure

This is an npm workspaces monorepo with six packages:

- **packages/ws-controller** (`@matter-server/ws-controller`): Core Matter controller library wrapping `@project-chip/matter.js`. Exports `MatterController`, `ControllerCommandHandler`, `WebSocketControllerHandler`, `ConfigStorage`, `ThreadDiagnosticsService`. Consumes `@matter/thread-br-client` for Thread Border Router discovery/diagnostics.
- **packages/ws-client** (`@matter-server/ws-client`): WebSocket client library + wire models for the Matter server (used by the dashboard and external clients)
- **packages/dashboard** (`@matter-server/dashboard`): Web UI built with Lit, Rollup, and Material Web Components. Connects to server via WebSocket
- **packages/matter-server** (`matter-server`): Main entry point. HTTP/WebSocket server using Express, combines controller + dashboard
- **packages/ble-proxy** (`@matter-server/ble-proxy`): BLE proxy implementation — proxies BLE operations over WebSocket for remote commissioning
- **packages/custom-clusters** (`@matter-server/custom-clusters`): Custom cluster definitions for matter.js-based projects
- Build tooling is provided by the external `@nacho-iot/js-tools` dev dependency (CLI binaries `nacho-build`, `nacho-run`).

## Architecture

### Server Flow

`MatterServer.ts` → creates `ConfigStorage` + `MatterController` → creates `WebServer` with handlers:

- `WebSocketControllerHandler`: Python Matter Server compatible WS API on `/ws`
- `StaticFileHandler`: Serves dashboard assets

### WebSocket Protocol

The server implements a protocol compatible with Home Assistant's Python Matter Server. Key commands:

- `start_listening`, `commission_with_code`, `device_command`, `read_attribute`, `write_attribute`
- Events: `node_added`, `node_updated`, `node_removed`, `attribute_updated`

### Key Dependencies

- `@project-chip/matter.js`: Core Matter protocol implementation
- `@matter/main`, `@matter/main/general`: Matter.js utilities
- `@matter/nodejs-ble`: Optional BLE support (enable with `--ble` flag)

## Build System

Uses external `@nacho-iot/js-tools` build system:

- TSC for type checking and declaration files
- esbuild for transpilation (ESM + CJS)
- Dashboard uses Rollup for bundling with Babel
- Shared tsconfigs live in `/tsc` at repo root (`tsconfig.base.json`, `tsconfig.lib.json`, `tsconfig.test.json`, `tsconfig.app.json`)

Package-level builds: `nacho-build` (aliased in each package.json)

Dashboard has additional `npm run generate` step for cluster descriptions.

## Node.js Requirements

Engine requirement: `>=22.13.0`

## Code Quality

### Tooling

- **Linter**: [oxlint](https://oxc.rs) with type-aware checking (config: `.oxlintrc.json`)
- **Formatter**: [oxfmt](https://oxc.rs) (config: `.oxfmtrc.json`)
- Both are Rust-based and run in <1s across the entire monorepo

### Checklist

**Always run these checks before considering work complete:**

```bash
# 1. Format code (required - MUST run first, oxfmt rewrites files in-place)
npm run format

# 2. Lint (required)
npm run lint

# 3. Build (required)
npm run build

# 4. Run tests (required). See note above — integration tests need both
#    PRIMARY_INTERFACE and MATTER_MDNS_NETWORKINTERFACE set to the active LAN
#    interface (e.g. en0). Without them, the Commission On Network test times out
#    when mDNS picks a VPN/utun interface.
PRIMARY_INTERFACE=en0 MATTER_MDNS_NETWORKINTERFACE=en0 npm test
```

All four checks must pass **in this order**. `npm run format` must be run **before** build/lint — it rewrites files in-place using oxfmt and the build/lint must validate the formatted output. Skipping format leads to formatting drift that gets caught later.

#### Test scoping during iteration

For fast iteration while working on a single workspace package, run scoped tests via the npm `-w` flag from the repo root. Example for `ws-controller`:

```bash
npm test -w @matter-server/ws-controller
```

This is the preferred verification mode for in-package work; the full `npm test` is the final gate before declaring work done.

#### Pre-existing integration test caveats

`packages/matter-server/test/IntegrationTest.ts` contains end-to-end tests that depend on real mDNS multicast and a live Matter device handshake on the local network. On developer machines and in some CI environments these can flake or fail with errors like:

- `Integration Test > Device Discovery > should discover commissionable nodes via discover command — expected undefined to exist`
- `Integration Test > Commission On Network > should commission device using passcode and long discriminator — expected '<vendor>' to equal 'Test Vendor'`

When the full `npm test` reports only these matter-server integration failures and your changes are confined to other packages (e.g. `ws-controller` non-discovery code paths, `dashboard`), treat them as pre-existing environment failures rather than regressions. Confirm by running scoped tests for your package via `npm test -w <workspace>`. Per the global "When tests fail" rule, ask before chasing failures you suspect are pre-existing.

### Plan Documents

Plan/design documents in `docs/plans/` are working files only. **Never commit them to git.** They may exist locally for reference but must not be included in any commit.

### Code Comments

WHY not WHAT. Only add a WHAT comment if the logic is genuinely non-obvious. Keep comments minimal. Audit every `//` and `/** */` before commit; **default to deleting, not shortening** — a wordy comment that survives review shorter is still a failure.

**Decisive test (primary lens):** *"Would I need this comment to understand the code later if I had to fix something right here?"* If no → delete. This catches the true-but-useless comment the checklist below lets slip.

Before adding any comment, ask in order:

1. Does the commit message / `git blame` already carry this context? → no comment.
2. Would a reader seeing only the final code (not the diff) benefit? → if no, no comment.
3. Does the code already speak for itself via identifiers + jsdoc? → if yes, no comment.
4. Am I narrating the change I just made rather than stating an invariant of the code? → put it in the commit message, not the code.
5. Can I say the WHY in ≤1 line? → if no, it's almost certainly over-explanation.

**Acceptable (rare) — keep to 1 line:**

- An invariant a future refactor could innocently break (forward-looking).
- A non-obvious spec / RFC / library constraint the code depends on.
- A tradeoff record ("we accept X because Y is worse").
- Cross-file / library coupling the type system can't express.

Example from this codebase: `// Shared Observable: an uncaught throw here aborts the emit and starves other connections` on a `try/catch` around an observer body — matter.js's `Observable.emit` catches each observer error but its default `handleError` *rethrows*, so a per-connection throw aborts the shared emit and starves other connections; without the comment a future fixer assumes the guard is redundant and removes it.

**Always-bad (delete on sight):**

- WHAT-restatement of an identifier or `if` condition (`// Store event in the buffer` above `this.#addEventToHistory(...)`).
- Changelog / historical narration ("Moved from A to B because…", "this used to do Y").
- "Now do X" above code that does X; multi-line explanations of what the diff does.
- Pointing at structure the reader can see ("Cleanup lives on an outer `.finally`", "Using a Map keyed by X").
- Mechanism trivia about standard APIs (".finally runs in a microtask", "Promise.all rejects on first failure").
- Rejected-alternative justification (`// .then().catch(), not .then(a,b)…`) — once the code IS that form, what it *isn't* is irrelevant; state the invariant, not the counterfactual.

## Dashboard Development

### Technology Stack

- **Lit 3.x**: Web components framework with TypeScript decorators
- **Material Web 2.4.x**: Material Design 3 components (`md-*` elements)
- **@mdi/js**: Material Design Icons as SVG paths
- **CSS Variables**: All colors use CSS custom properties for theming

### Styling Patterns

- All components use inline `static override styles = css\`...\`` (Lit pattern)
- Colors must use CSS variables from `public/index.html`, not hardcoded values
- Key variables: `--md-sys-color-primary`, `--md-sys-color-surface`, `--md-sys-color-on-surface`, `--md-sys-color-on-surface-variant`
- Dark mode: Variables overridden in `html.dark-theme body` selector

### Theme-Aware Colors

When defining colors in dashboard components, **always use CSS variables** that are defined for both light and dark themes:

```css
/* CORRECT - uses theme variable with fallback */
color: var(--text-color, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6));
background: var(--md-sys-color-surface);

/* WRONG - hardcoded color won't adapt to dark mode */
color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6);
color: #333333;
color: grey;
```

Available theme variables defined in `public/index.html`:

- `--text-color`: Secondary text (grey) - adapts for light/dark
- `--danger-color`: Error/warning red
- `--primary-color`: Primary accent color
- `--md-sys-color-*`: Material Design system colors

Always verify new colors look correct in both light AND dark themes before committing.

### Theme System

- `src/util/theme-service.ts`: Singleton managing theme state
- Supports: `light`, `dark`, `system` (OS auto-detect)
- Persisted in localStorage (`matterTheme` key)
- Query parameter override: `?theme=dark|light|system`

### Key Dashboard Files

- `public/index.html`: CSS variables for light/dark themes
- `src/util/theme-service.ts`: Theme management singleton
- `src/pages/components/header.ts`: Header bar with theme toggle
- `src/pages/matter-dashboard-app.ts`: Main app with connection states
- `src/components/ha-svg-icon.ts`: Custom SVG icon component

### Common Pitfalls

- Don't use hardcoded colors like `#673ab7` or `cornsilk` - use CSS variables
- Material Web components need proper `--md-sys-color-*` variables to render correctly in dark mode
- When adding status/error pages, include the header component for consistent UX
- The dashboard is served by the Matter Server, so `location.reload()` fails when server is offline - use WebSocket reconnect instead

## Design Context

### Users

Two distinct audiences served equally:

1. **Home Assistant power users** — technically capable smart home enthusiasts managing their Matter network. Need clear device status, easy commissioning, and network health at a glance.
2. **Developers and testers** — building or debugging Matter integrations. Need raw data, attribute inspection, cluster details, and diagnostic information.

Both audiences benefit from information density. Neither needs hand-holding.

### Brand Personality

**Utilitarian, dense, reliable.** Tool-first. The dashboard should feel like a well-built instrument panel — everything needed visible, nothing decorative for its own sake.

### Aesthetic Direction

- Material Design 3 as foundation — refine rather than replace
- Both light and dark modes, equal quality in each
- Current design is acceptable baseline — improvements focus on polish, color mode consistency, spacing, and information hierarchy
- Anti-references: not a "hacker dashboard", not overly decorative, not consumer marketing

### Design Principles

1. **Density over decoration** — Show more data in less space. Every pixel earns its place.
2. **State clarity** — Online/offline, connection quality, commissioning status must be instantly readable. Color-code consistently.
3. **Both modes, equal quality** — Light and dark themes both intentional, not one an afterthought.
4. **Material as infrastructure** — Use MD components for consistency, override tokens where it improves the tool feel.
5. **Progressive detail** — Overview first, drill-down on demand.

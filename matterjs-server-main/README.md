# Open Home Foundation Matter(.js) Server

![Matter Logo](docs/matter_logo.svg)

> [!WARNING]
> This is an Beta version of a matter.js-based controller with a [Python Matter Server](https://github.com/matter-js/python-matter-server) compatible WebSocket interface.
> This version is not yet officially re-certified by the CSA, but will be in the future.
>
> Please refer to the [Beta testing instructions](ALPHABETATESTS.md) how to test this version.

The Open Home Foundation Matter Server serves as the foundation to provide Matter support to [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) but its universal approach makes it suitable to be used in other projects too.

This project implements a Matter Controller Server over WebSockets using JavaScript Matter SDK [matter.js](https://github.com/matter-js/matter.js)
as a base and provides a server implementation.

The Open Home Foundation Matter Server software component is a project of the [Open Home Foundation](https://www.openhomefoundation.org/).

The current version of the server supports Matter 1.6.0 and is a drop-in replacement for the Python Matter Server.

This repository consists of multiple packages that are provided in the `packages` directory:

- `matter-server`: The OHF Matter Server using the below packages to provide functionality on a webserver (published to npmjs as `matter-server`)
- `ws-controller`: The WebSocket-based Matter Controller implementation using matter.js (published to npmjs as `@matter-server/ws-controller`)
- `ws-client`: A WebSocket client library for connecting to the Matter Server (usable in browser and Node.js) (published to npmjs as `@matter-server/ws-client`)
- `custom-clusters`: A set of community-provided custom Matter clusters used by the Matter Server (published to npmjs as `@matter-server/custom-clusters`)
- `dashboard`: A dashboard to interact with the Matter Server and show node detailed data (published to npmjs as `@matter-server/dashboard`)

## Beta testing instructions

As mentioned above the enw Matter server is currently in a Testing phase.

Please see the [Beta testing instructions](ALPHABETATESTS.md) for more information.

## Installation / Running the Matter Server

- Endusers of Home Assistant, refer to the [Home Assistant documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/matter/) how to run Matter in Home Assistant using the official Matter Server add-on, which is based on this project. Choose the "Beta" version if you want to test the matter.js based server (soon)

- For running the server and/or client in your development environment, see the [Development documentation](DEVELOPMENT.md).

- For running the Matter Server as a standalone docker container, see our instructions [here](docs/docker.md).

### Manual installation (from npm)

- Ensure you have Node.js 22.13+, 24.x or 26.x installed (24.x recommended)
- `npm install matter-server`
- `npx matter-server` or alternatively `cd node_modules/matter-server && npm run server`

If you want to provide more parameters when using "npm run" (not needed when using npx!) use an extra "--" to separate parameters, see below.

### Manual installation (for local development)

- clone the repository
- `npm i` in the root directory to install npm dependencies and do initial build
- (`npm run build`) if ever needed after changing code
- `npm run server` to start it

The server is started on port localhost:5580 and listens fpr WS on "/ws"

Configure the HA instance against this server and have fun :-)

### Tips

- to control the storage directory use `--storage-path data` as parameter to use local dir `data` for storage
- to limit network interfaces (especially good idea on Macs sometimes) use `--primary-interface en0`

So as example to do both use `npm run server -- --storage-path data --primary-interface en0` (note the extra "--" to pass parameters to the script).

### Debugging / Log Level

**Temporary log level changes via Dashboard**: You can change the log level at runtime without restarting the server. Open the Dashboard at `http://localhost:5580`, go to **Settings**, and adjust the log level (e.g., switch to `debug` for troubleshooting, then back to `info`). Changes are temporary and reset on server restart.

**Startup log level**: Use `--log-level debug` when starting the server for debug output from the beginning. Available levels: `critical`, `error`, `warning`, `info`, `debug`, `verbose`.

**Docker**: Set the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable (e.g., `-e LOG_LEVEL=debug`).

### Running Behind a Reverse Proxy

When running the Matter Server behind a reverse proxy (e.g., nginx, traefik), the dashboard may not automatically detect that it should connect to the server. This happens because the dashboard normally detects production mode by checking for port `:5580` or Home Assistant ingress paths in the URL.

To fix this, use the `--production-mode` flag or `PRODUCTION_MODE=true` environment variable:

```bash
# CLI
npm run server -- --production-mode

# Docker
docker run ... -e PRODUCTION_MODE=true ghcr.io/matter-js/matterjs-server:stable
```

This tells the dashboard to automatically connect to the WebSocket server at the current URL instead of prompting for a server address.

It was in general tested with a simply slight bulb on network.

Ble and Wifi should work when server gets startes with `--ble` flag, but Wifi only will work. For Thread Matter.js currently requires a network Name which is not provided.

### BLE Proxy mode

Alternatively, start the server with `--ble-proxy` (or `BLE_PROXY=true`) to expose a
`/ble` WebSocket endpoint instead of using a local BLE adapter. A separate process —
Home Assistant's Matter integration, the Bleak-based Python CLI
[`matter-ble-proxy`](python_ble_proxy/README.md), or the Noble JS reference client
[`@matter-server/ble-proxy`](packages/ble-proxy/README.md) — connects to that endpoint and
bridges BLE traffic from wherever the adapter actually lives. See
[`docs/ble-proxy-protocol.md`](docs/ble-proxy-protocol.md) for the protocol spec.

When using the BLE proxy mode together with Home Assistant (which uses the ble-proxy-python -client), you need:

- Home Assistant 2026.6 (or later)
- ESPHome 2026.5 (or later)
- esp-idf 6.0.1 (or later)

In your ESPHome device.yaml, use:

```
esp32:
  […]
  framework:
    type: esp-idf
    version: 6.0.1
```

## Internet access requirements

Ideally, the Matter server has access to the internet which is needed for the following functionalities:

- Checking Device Attestation (validity of certification) and Certificates and Certificate Revocations during the commissioning process (requires access to the CSA DCL - Distributed Compliance Ledger)
- Checking Certification status during the commissioning process (requires access to the CSA DCL)
- Collecting Vendor Information to lookup the Vendor ID (requires access to the CSA DCL)
- Checking for OTA device updates (requires access to the CSA DCL)
- Download OTA device updates (requires access to vendor specific Download locations returned by the CSA DCL)

Without Internet access no OTA update checks or OTA update download is possible. You can still add [OTA files manually to the server](#importing-custom-ota-firmware-files).
For Certificates, Certification verifications, and vendor lookup the server uses a package of seed data and will (if not disabled, see above) pre-install data from the time from release of this matter server version. These data might be outdated and certificates might be missing depending on your devices, which could lead to errors when you try to commission devices.

## Dashboard Network Visualization

The dashboard includes interactive network topology graphs for Thread and WiFi networks, accessible via the navigation tabs. These graphs are only available on screens wider than 768px and are hidden on mobile devices.

For an end-user legend explaining the visual encodings — line styles, arrow direction, role badges, signal colors, and the "Bidir" / "one-way" / "reverse" terms — see [Network Visualization in the dashboard README](packages/dashboard/README.md#network-visualization).

### Thread Network Graph

Displays the Thread mesh network topology showing how your Thread devices connect to each other. The graph visualizes:

- **Device nodes** with icons based on device type (lights, sensors, plugs, etc.)
- **Mesh connections** between Thread devices, with line style, color, and arrows encoding link state and signal strength (see the legend linked above)
- **Thread roles**: Leader, Router, End Device, Sleepy End Device — shown as corner badges (see the legend linked above)
- **Border Routers**: External devices identified via mDNS (`_meshcop._udp` + `_trel._udp`) are rendered with a router icon and a two-line label showing the device hostname and the Thread network name. Click a Border Router node to see its full mDNS-derived details — vendor, model, Thread version, hostname, IP addresses, MeshCoP/TREL ports, extended PAN ID, partition ID, active timestamp, state bitmap, border-agent ID, and which commissioned nodes report it as a neighbor.
- **Unknown / External devices**: Thread routers that appear in commissioned-node neighbor tables but cannot be matched to a known Border Router are shown with a question-mark icon and dashed edges. When their Thread network can be resolved (because at least one Border Router on the same extended PAN ID is known via mDNS), the network name is shown as a second line on the label and in the details panel.

### WiFi Network Graph

Displays WiFi devices grouped by their access point (router). Each access point forms a star topology with connected devices.

### Important: Data Source Limitations

The network topology data is obtained **directly from the commissioned Matter devices** via their diagnostic clusters (Thread Network Diagnostics, WiFi Network Diagnostics), and Border Router enrichment data is obtained from passive mDNS discovery on the local network. This means:

1. **Border Routers are best-effort identified via mDNS**: The server subscribes to `_meshcop._udp.local` and `_trel._udp.local` to learn each BR's friendly name, vendor, model, addresses, and Thread network identity. The BR is then matched against external entries seen in commissioned-node neighbor tables by extended address.

2. **Some routers may still appear as "Unknown" even on a recognized network**: Several Border Router vendors (notably Apple and Aqara) advertise a stable border-agent identifier as the MeshCoP `xa` field while their Thread radio MAC visible to neighboring routers is a different value (sometimes randomized at every boot for privacy). When that happens the same physical device shows up twice — once as a known Border Router (matched via its MeshCoP `xa`) and once as an "External Router" carrying its current Thread radio MAC. The unknown-device details panel labels these with the Thread network name (resolved via the shared extended PAN ID) so the relationship is visible. There is no protocol-level way to merge them today; widening the match would require Thread to expose a cross-reference between the border-agent ID and the radio MAC.

3. **Connection data is device-reported**: The neighbor tables and signal strength values come from what each device reports about its neighbors. This may not represent a complete picture of the network.

4. **Not all network participants are Matter devices**: Thread networks often include infrastructure devices (Border Routers, range extenders) that are not Matter devices and cannot be commissioned. The mDNS-based BR enrichment described above identifies the BRs we can; everything else stays in the unknown bucket with a question-mark icon.

5. **Bidirectional visibility**: A connection appears when at least one device reports the other as a neighbor. The details panel shows both "outgoing" connections (what this device reports) and "reverse" connections (what other devices report about this device).

### Using the Graphs

- **Click a node** to select it and view details in the sidebar
- **"Show in graph" button** on node detail pages navigates to the network view with that node selected
- **Fit-to-screen button** adjusts the zoom to show all nodes
- **Drag nodes** to rearrange the layout (physics will re-stabilize)

### Device Icons

Each node in the graph is shown with an icon based on its Matter device type. The icon mapping is defined in [`packages/dashboard/src/util/device-icons.ts`](packages/dashboard/src/util/device-icons.ts). Icons come from [Material Design Icons (MDI)](https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/), which provides over 7400 icons.

If you notice a missing or misleading icon for your device type, we welcome PRs to improve the mapping. To find a suitable icon, browse the [MDI icon library](https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/) or use [MDI Search](https://mdisearch.com/) for quick lookup. Devices without a specific mapping show a generic chip icon as the default.

## Importing Custom OTA Firmware Files

The Matter Server supports importing custom OTA (Over-The-Air) firmware update files for your Matter devices. This is useful when you have manufacturer-provided firmware files that aren't available through the official DCL (Distributed Compliance Ledger).

### Requirements

To use custom OTA files, you must:

1. **Enable test-net DCL mode** using `--enable-test-net-dcl` (or env var `ENABLE_TEST_NET_DCL=true`)
2. **Specify an OTA provider directory** using `--ota-provider-dir <path>` (or env var `OTA_PROVIDER_DIR=<path>`)

Both options are required. If `--ota-provider-dir` is set but `--enable-test-net-dcl` is not enabled, custom OTA files will be ignored and a warning will be logged.

Without your own directory, enabling the `--enable-test-net-dcl` flag would still check the CSA Test-DCL (and Production DCL) for updates available there.

### How It Works

1. Place your Matter OTA image files (`.ota` format) in the configured OTA provider directory
2. When the server starts, it automatically scans the directory and imports all valid OTA files
3. The server extracts metadata (vendor ID, product ID, software version) from each OTA image
4. **Important**: Successfully imported files are automatically deleted from the directory after import
5. JSON files (`.json`) in the directory are skipped and can be used for your own metadata or notes

### Example Usage

```bash
# Create a directory for OTA files
mkdir -p /path/to/ota-files

# Place your .ota files in that directory
cp device-firmware-v2.0.ota /path/to/ota-files/

# Start the server with OTA support
npx matter-server --enable-test-net-dcl --ota-provider-dir /path/to/ota-files
```

Or using environment variables (useful for Docker):

```bash
export ENABLE_TEST_NET_DCL=true
export OTA_PROVIDER_DIR=/path/to/ota-files
npx matter-server
```

### Notes

- OTA files must be in the standard Matter OTA image format
- The server stores imported OTA images internally for serving to devices
- To disable OTA functionality entirely, use `--disable-ota` (or env var `DISABLE_OTA=true`)
- Check the server logs for information about successfully imported OTA files

## Differences from Python Matter Server

This implementation aims to be API-compatible with the [Python Matter Server](https://github.com/home-assistant-libs/python-matter-server), but there are some intentional differences:

| Feature                 | Python Matter Server                                       | Matter.js Server                                                                                           |

| Storage Format          | Single `chip.json` and `{fabricId}.json` file              | matter.js native storage (migration supported)                                                             |
| Attribute Subscriptions | Tracks per-node in `attribute_subscriptions`               | Always empty (handled internally)                                                                          |
| Custom OTA Files        | Allows to import them independently from the test-dcl flag | Only imports them when also test-dcl is enabled                                                            |
